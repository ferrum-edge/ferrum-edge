## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Plugin egress no longer inherits ambient proxy configuration
  (GHSA-c4pj-vq6x-53rw). Backend dispatch `reqwest` clients (via
  `BackendTlsConfigBuilder::build_reqwest`), active health-check clients
  (primary, custom-TLS, and degraded DNS-cached fallbacks), the dedicated
  ClickHouse client built by `api_chargeback_sink` for custom CA / mTLS /
  relaxed-verification settings, and the dedicated `spec_expose` and
  `load_testing` clients now call `reqwest::ClientBuilder::no_proxy()` like the
  shared `PluginHttpClient` and its fallback builders. With a proxy selected
  from `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY`, Ferrum resolved and screened
  the *proxy* while the proxy resolved and connected to the configured hostname,
  so the ultimate destination never passed `BackendEgressPolicy`. A CI guard
  now fails if any policy-governed `reqwest` builder drops `.no_proxy()`.
- `ws_logging` now enforces backend egress policy on the address it actually
  dials (GHSA-mp2j-gjfp-2vm8). Every connection and reconnection resolves the
  endpoint fresh (bypassing both DNS cache layers), rejects the complete A+AAAA
  answer if any candidate is denied, rechecks each candidate immediately before
  its socket is opened, and dials only screened addresses. The configured
  hostname is retained as the TLS SNI / certificate identity and the WebSocket
  `Host` authority. Previously the endpoint was handed to `tokio-tungstenite`,
  which resolved and dialed it outside the policy, so a hostname could rebind to
  a denied address between admission and any later reconnect.
- `kafka_logging` bootstrap parsing now matches the pinned librdkafka grammar
  (`[proto://]host[:port]`, URL-path truncation, bracketed-IPv6 port rules,
  empty host → `localhost`), so protocol-prefixed denied literals such as
  `PLAINTEXT://169.254.169.254:9092` are rejected instead of evading a
  `host:port`-only screen. Entries whose protocol prefix disagrees with
  `security_protocol` are rejected rather than silently truncating the broker
  list the way librdkafka would.
- ACME issuance and renewal now route every connection through a
  Ferrum-controlled, public-only fresh-DNS connector; reject mixed/private DNS
  answers, answers above 64 addresses, ambiguous legacy numeric IPv4 host
  spellings, endpoint origin drift, credential-directory mismatch, legacy
  credential URL sets, hostile order resource URLs, redirects, and response
  bodies above 1 MiB while preserving HTTPS hostname/certificate verification.
  Fresh DNS plus all TCP candidates share one 30-second wall-clock budget.
  **Breaking:** ACME servers that advertise endpoints on another host or port,
  and pre-0.4 `instant-acme` credentials with embedded `urls`, must be migrated
  to the configured directory origin (#2407).
- `body_validator` now enforces the validation it advertises on all four of its
  surfaces. Configured JSON Schemas are compiled once at plugin construction with
  the `jsonschema` crate under an explicit draft (`json_schema_draft`, default
  `draft2020-12`) instead of being interpreted by a partial handwritten
  evaluator, so `$ref`/`$defs`, union types, conditionals, and other standard
  keywords take effect and malformed schemas, invalid type names, non-local
  references, `$vocabulary` declarations, and over-budget schemas fail
  configuration closed; local JSON Pointer targets are policy-audited even under
  normally literal containers, and no external reference is ever retrieved. XML
  bodies are parsed exactly, without Unicode whitespace trimming, with
  `roxmltree` rather than scanned for balanced tags, so multiple roots, text
  outside the root, invalid names or characters, malformed/unquoted/duplicate
  attributes, and undeclared entity references are rejected. External
  `SYSTEM`/`PUBLIC` identifiers on either the DOCTYPE or an entity declaration
  are refused outright, and `required_xml_elements` matches parsed
  namespace-expanded names. Decoded gRPC protobuf messages must satisfy
  proto2 `required`-field initialization recursively, including inside present
  nested, repeated, map, and extension message values. Unknown top-level config
  keys and unknown keys inside a `protobuf_method_messages` entry are rejected
  before defaults, so a typo can no longer silently replace enforcement with a
  weaker policy. This is a breaking configuration change; see the
  [Safe Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrade_guide.md#body-validator-enforcement-hardening).
- **`request_deduplication` Redis ownership is now atomically fenced**
  (GHSA-f72h-jm2p-mc73). Ownership and completion share one versioned operation
  record per logical key. Completion is a compare-and-set on the owner's exact
  in-flight record, so an owner whose `inflight_ttl_seconds` lease expired can
  neither overwrite a successor's completed response nor publish while a
  successor owns the operation; such a completion is discarded locally too
  instead of being replayed as a non-authoritative result. Redis-mode logical
  keys move to `v4`, unconditionally include the matched proxy namespace even
  under an explicitly shared Redis prefix, and the record format is versioned,
  so a rolling upgrade reads and writes disjoint keys instead of mixing
  formats. Current-version records with missing ownership fences, impossible
  state fields, or mismatched inner/outer fingerprints fail closed. A new
  `on_redis_unavailable` field decides outage behavior and **defaults to
  `fail_closed` (HTTP 503)**; deployments that prefer the previous
  process-local fallback must set `on_redis_unavailable: "local_only"`.
- **`request_deduplication` rejects unknown configuration keys**
  (GHSA-h2c3-j3cm-7ghh). The runtime constructor and the OpenAPI
  `RequestDeduplicationConfig` schema now share one closed allowlist, so a
  misspelled `enforce_required` or `sync_mode` fails admission with a
  path-qualified diagnostic instead of silently reverting to a permissive
  default. Redis-only keys are additionally rejected outside
  `sync_mode: "redis"`. Existing configurations carrying stray keys, or
  `redis_*` fields in local mode, must be corrected before upgrade.
- **Completed external operations behind a synthetic response now leave a
  durable completion** (GHSA-8cr6-rw38-7j59). `serverless_function` terminate
  mode and `ai_federation` provider calls declare that their short-circuit
  performed the protected billable operation; deduplication publishes a
  non-replayable 409 completion tombstone — fenced in Redis mode — on buffered,
  empty/HEAD, streamed-fallthrough, and interrupted-delivery outcomes alike.
  Previously an interrupted delivery only held a bare in-flight marker, so an
  identical retry re-executed the operation once `inflight_ttl_seconds` elapsed.
  The tombstone is retained for `max(ttl_seconds, inflight_ttl_seconds)`: it
  replaces a marker that blocked duplicates for `inflight_ttl_seconds`, so a
  deployment configured with `inflight_ttl_seconds > ttl_seconds` never becomes
  re-executable sooner than it was before. Ordinary replayable completions keep
  `ttl_seconds`. The barrier also covers the case where the committed response
  itself cannot be retained as a replay — its request straddled a
  response-presentation-policy publication, or that policy is incomplete or
  `Dynamic` — instead of falling back to the bare in-flight lease. Local
  response-byte admission failure and later protected-completion eviction now
  use an explicit fixed-size execution barrier carrying the completion's own
  authoritative retention clock; neither path can silently restart a shorter
  `inflight_ttl_seconds` lease. Stale owner hooks cannot clear the barrier or a
  successor because every transition remains fingerprint/token fenced. Per-key
  execution barriers are hard-capped at `max_entries`; overflow extends one
  fixed process-global deadline that returns 503 for applicable idempotency-key
  requests, preserving fail-closed retention without unbounded key storage.
  Serverless responses with stable, complete policy provenance are still stored
  as ordinary replays. The provenance contract is documented in
  `docs/plugin_execution_order.md`.
- Versioned standard and `-ebpf` multi-architecture images are now keylessly
  signed in Docker Hub and GHCR and carry final-manifest SLSA provenance plus
  per-platform SPDX SBOM attestations. A fail-closed publication gate requires
  identity, signature, subject-digest, source-commit, provenance, and SBOM
  verification and retracts a GitHub Release if attestation does not succeed
  (compatible with the trusted Cross `create-release.needs` contract).
- `ai_semantic_cache` no longer discards Redis quarantine-`DEL` failures for
  malformed, oversized, empty, or otherwise inadmissible entries. Failed deletes
  are counted with rate-limited warnings that omit keys, payloads, credentials,
  and endpoints, and a bounded per-instance local suppressor (content fingerprint
  + 30s TTL, hard-capped, constant-work capacity eviction) prevents immediate
  re-download/parse/delete amplification of the same poisoned remote value while
  still reconsidering repaired replacements within that bound. Quarantine
  fingerprints are computed only after a Redis value fails admission, so valid
  hits are not hashed for poison markers. Invalid entries remain unserved;
  deletion failure cannot convert a miss into a hit (issue #3213).
- `response_caching` now applies RFC 9111 §3.5 shared-cache admission to the
  live request credential rather than only to a gateway-minted identity, so a
  gateway that forwards `Authorization` to a backend that validates it no longer
  retains the protected response without an explicit `public` /
  `must-revalidate` / `s-maxage` opt-in. `cache_key_include_consumer` remains a
  key-partition option but no longer overrides the origin's storage policy.
  Backend-side revocation, expiry, and scope changes are no longer masked for
  the entry's lifetime (GHSA-7f28-wh4x-5375).
- `Cache-Control` is parsed with quoted-string awareness, so the qualified
  `private="…"` and `no-cache="…"` field-name forms are understood. Named fields
  are removed from the retained entry instead of being replayed from the shared
  cache, and a malformed qualified argument fails closed to the bare directive.
  Connection-scoped and proxy-authentication response fields are also stripped
  before storage (GHSA-fpx2-5v4j-wqxq).
- `1xx`, `206`, and `304` can no longer be configured in
  `cacheable_status_codes`, are refused again at store time, and are never
  replayed; a response carrying `Content-Range` is likewise never stored. A
  caller can no longer poison a shared cache with a partial or validator-only
  representation (GHSA-v7fj-73gm-h625). **Breaking:** existing plugin rows
  containing those statuses must be repaired before upgrade — see the
  [Safe Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrade_guide.md#response-cache-shared-storage-hardening).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `kafka_logging` now fails closed under any restrictive backend
  egress policy, including the default posture. librdkafka resolves bootstrap
  hostnames itself and dials brokers advertised by cluster metadata, and the
  pinned `rdkafka 0.39` exposes no connect/resolve callback, so those addresses
  cannot be screened. The plugin is admitted only under a fully-open policy
  (`FERRUM_BACKEND_ALLOW_IPS=both`, no `FERRUM_BACKEND_DENY_CIDRS`,
  `FERRUM_BACKEND_BLOCK_DANGEROUS_RANGES=false`). Deployments that need Kafka log
  shipping under a restrictive policy should ship through a policy-aware sink
  (`http_logging`, `tcp_logging`, `ws_logging`, `loki_logging`) and bridge to
  Kafka outside the gateway. See
  [Backend Egress / SSRF Protection](docs/configuration.md#kafka_logging-requires-a-fully-open-egress-policy).

- Authenticated `/metrics` now renders TLS certificate gauges from a cached,
  non-secret TLS inventory snapshot and performs no certificate, private-key,
  Kubernetes, HSM, or cloud-secret I/O on the scrape path. The snapshot is
  refreshed by a bounded single-flight background task governed by the new
  `FERRUM_TLS_INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT_TTL_SECONDS` (default 300, `0` disables it), its
  freshness is exported as `ferrum_tls_inventory_snapshot_timestamp_seconds` /
  `ferrum_tls_inventory_snapshot_max_age_seconds`, and certificate gauges are
  absent until the first snapshot is published. `GET /admin/tls/inventory` still
  collects live.
- Added release governance requiring version tags to match the package version and
  requiring build-out breaking changes to be recorded here.
- Hardened `tcp_connection_throttle` config loading to fail closed for
  unsupported-only global targets, non-TCP scoped attachments, unknown config
  fields, and cleanup intervals above 86400 seconds. Existing deployments must
  remediate these rows before upgrade; see the
  [Safe Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrade_guide.md#tcp-connection-throttle-validation-hardening).
