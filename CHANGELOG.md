## [Unreleased]

### Security

- `response_caching` now applies RFC 9111 §3.5 shared-cache admission to the
  live request credential rather than only to a gateway-minted identity, so a
  gateway that forwards `Authorization` to a backend that validates it no longer
  retains the protected response without an explicit `public` /
  `must-revalidate` / `s-maxage` opt-in. `cache_key_include_consumer` remains a
  key-partition option but no longer overrides the origin's storage policy.
  Backend-side revocation, expiry, and scope changes are no longer masked for
  the entry's lifetime (GHSA-7f28-wh4x-5375).
- `Cache-Control` is parsed with quoted-string awareness, so the qualified
  `private="…"` and `no-cache="…"` field-name forms are understood. Named fields
  are removed from the retained entry instead of being replayed from the shared
  cache, and a malformed qualified argument fails closed to the bare directive.
  Connection-scoped and proxy-authentication response fields are also stripped
  before storage (GHSA-fpx2-5v4j-wqxq).
- `1xx`, `206`, and `304` can no longer be configured in
  `cacheable_status_codes`, are refused again at store time, and are never
  replayed; a response carrying `Content-Range` is likewise never stored. A
  caller can no longer poison a shared cache with a partial or validator-only
  representation (GHSA-v7fj-73gm-h625). **Breaking:** existing plugin rows
  containing those statuses must be repaired before upgrade — see the
  [Safe Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrade_guide.md#response-cache-shared-storage-hardening).

### Changed

- Authenticated `/metrics` now renders TLS certificate gauges from a cached,
  non-secret TLS inventory snapshot and performs no certificate, private-key,
  Kubernetes, HSM, or cloud-secret I/O on the scrape path. The snapshot is
  refreshed by a bounded single-flight background task governed by the new
  `FERRUM_TLS_INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT_TTL_SECONDS` (default 300, `0` disables it), its
  freshness is exported as `ferrum_tls_inventory_snapshot_timestamp_seconds` /
  `ferrum_tls_inventory_snapshot_max_age_seconds`, and certificate gauges are
  absent until the first snapshot is published. `GET /admin/tls/inventory` still
  collects live.
- Added release governance requiring version tags to match the package version and
  requiring build-out breaking changes to be recorded here.
- Hardened `tcp_connection_throttle` config loading to fail closed for
  unsupported-only global targets, non-TCP scoped attachments, unknown config
  fields, and cleanup intervals above 86400 seconds. Existing deployments must
  remediate these rows before upgrade; see the
  [Safe Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrade_guide.md#tcp-connection-throttle-validation-hardening).

## [0.9.0]

Ferrum Edge 0.9.0 represents the current build-out baseline: a multi-protocol
edge proxy with file, database, control-plane, data-plane, mesh, injector, and
node-agent modes plus its plugin and operational tooling. This entry is
intentionally coarse-grained rather than a reconstruction of unreleased history;
see [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ferrum-edge/ferrum-edge/releases) for
published release notes.
