# Launch readiness gate

Fail-closed release governance for Ferrum Edge. The live launch verdict is
computed by `scripts/check_launch_readiness.py` from GitHub issue and advisory
state plus the checked-in policy; it is **not** the historical static-audit prose
in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

## Authoritative inputs

| Input | Role |
|-------|------|
| [`docs/launch-blocker-policy.json`](launch-blocker-policy.json) | Machine-readable blocker contract: labels, tiers, state machine, tracked inventory, private-advisory redaction rules and freshness ceiling |
| [`docs/launch-exemptions.json`](launch-exemptions.json) | Structured, expiring exemptions (owner, approver, rationale, compensating control, expiry) |
| Live GitHub issues API (paginated) | Open/closed state, `state_reason`, labels, linked in-flight PRs |
| Live repository security-advisories API (paginated) | Private/draft blockers as a **redacted count only**, when a dedicated advisory token is available |
| Repository Actions variables `LAUNCH_PRIVATE_BLOCKER_COUNT` / `LAUNCH_PRIVATE_ADVISORY_AS_OF` | Externally maintained redacted count and audit timestamp used when no advisory token is available |

Issue bodies, PR bodies, and advisory text are untrusted data: never executed,
never echoed. Only public issue numbers and severity/state categories are
printed. Advisory identifiers, summaries, descriptions, links, and any other
confidential field are never read into the record, and the summary printer
refuses to emit output containing them.

The checked-in tree can never assert that private advisories are clear. The
policy file defines only the freshness ceiling; a count or an as-of value inside
it is rejected by schema validation precisely because a pull request could edit
it.

## Classification

1. **Label discovery:** the whole `launch-blocker` label set is walked with
   pagination. Pull-request nodes are excluded. Each remaining issue must carry
   exactly one configured `severity:{critical,high,medium}` label; zero, several,
   or malformed severity is `UNKNOWN`, never a silent omission.
2. **Tracked inventory:** `tracked_blockers` in the policy is an explicit,
   CODEOWNERS-reviewed list evaluated even before labels are applied. The tracked
   severity is the contract: a live severity label that disagrees with it is a
   schema mismatch (`UNKNOWN`), never a downgrade or a silent replacement. A
   matching label is accepted; an absent label uses the tracked severity.
3. **States:**
   - `open` — blocking
   - `in_flight` — open issue with open implementation PR(s); still blocking
   - `merged_awaiting_issue_close` — linked PR merged, issue still open; still blocking
   - `closed_completed` — `state_reason=completed`; cleared
   - `closed_other` — `duplicate` / `not_planned` / missing reason; **not** a fix
   - `exempted` — valid, unexpired structured exemption for the selected tier
   An unrecognized close reason is `UNKNOWN`. The `launch-exempted` label without
   an active structured exemption is `UNKNOWN`; the bare label never clears a
   blocker, and an expired exemption returns the issue to the blocker set.
4. **Private advisories:** unpublished (`draft`/`triage`) advisories whose
   severity blocks the selected tier contribute only a redacted count. A
   non-object entry, a missing/unknown `state`, an unknown `severity`, or an
   incomplete pagination walk is `UNKNOWN` — malformed rows are never dropped.

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning | Exit |
|---------|---------|------|
| `PASS` | No blocking public issues and zero redacted private blockers for the tier | 0 (only when the checked-in snapshot agrees) |
| `FAIL` | At least one blocking public issue or redacted private blocker | non-zero |
| `UNKNOWN` | Missing token, API/rate-limit/pagination/schema/staleness failure | non-zero |

Only a computed `PASS` can make the hosted job green. A checked-in `FAIL`
snapshot that agrees with a computed `FAIL` is still a non-zero exit: while real
launch blockers are open this check is expected to be red, and that redness is
never traded for a "parity" success. A claimed `PASS` that disagrees with the
computed verdict also fails.

The snapshot inside the `launch-readiness` markers in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
is a reviewed record, not an input: it may only agree with the live evaluation.
Refresh it from the workflow's printed record, which carries the exact target SHA
and as-of UTC, whenever the blocker set changes.

## Private advisory access — setup and maintenance

Repository security advisories are behind a **separate GitHub permission**. The
Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot list them, and the workflow `security-events: read`
permission does **not** grant that access — it covers code-scanning alerts. A run
that relied on it would receive `403`. Both workflows therefore omit it.

Two supported sources, in order:

1. **Live API (preferred).** Provision a read-only credential that can list this
   repository's security advisories and store it as the repository secret
   `LAUNCH_ADVISORY_READ_TOKEN`. It is exposed **only** to trusted executions
   (`push` to `main`, tags, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`, and the release
   workflow). Pull-request and merge-group runs are given an empty value by
   construction, so untrusted code never sees a privileged advisory token. Any
   live failure — denial, rate limit, transport, pagination, or schema — is
   `UNKNOWN`; it never falls back to a weaker source.
2. **Externally maintained redacted variables.** When no advisory token is
   configured, the checker reads the repository *variables*
   `LAUNCH_PRIVATE_BLOCKER_COUNT` (a non-negative decimal count) and
   `LAUNCH_PRIVATE_ADVISORY_AS_OF` (an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp such as
   `2026-08-11T12:00:00Z`). Repository variables are set by a maintainer in
   repository settings; a pull request can read them but cannot change them,
   which is the only reason a zero there may substantiate a clean private state.
   Missing, malformed, future-dated, or older than
   `private_advisories.trusted_fallback.max_age_seconds` (7 days) ⇒ `UNKNOWN`.
   A maintainer with advisory access re-audits the private queue within that
   window and updates both variables together. Record **only** the count and the
   timestamp: never a GHSA identifier, summary, link, or any other detail.

No credential is stored in this repository, and none is printed.

## Hosted enforcement

- `.github/workflows/launch-readiness.yml` — pull requests, `merge_group`,
  `main` pushes, `v*` tags, a daily schedule, and `workflow_dispatch`. It runs
  the deterministic self-tests, then verifies the live verdict for the exact
  commit under test (PR head, merge-group head, or pushed SHA) and asserts that
  the checkout is that commit.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — the `validate-launch-readiness` job gates
  every tag release on a computed `PASS` for the tagged commit resolved from the
  checked-out tag ref.
- Both keep `persist-credentials: false` and least permissions.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` covers the policy, the exemptions, the checker, the
  workflow, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

## Determinism

Every freshness decision is made against an explicitly injected clock: production
passes the real UTC clock, and the fixture suite passes fixed instants. There is
no test-only bypass of production freshness — the tests simply supply their own
consistent `now`, so a fixture verdict can never be collapsed by the wall clock.

## Local / CI invocation

Hosted CI is the execution gate; the deterministic self-test is offline.

```bash
python3 scripts/check_launch_readiness.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_launch_readiness.py --verify --launch-tier ga --target-sha "$GITHUB_SHA"
```

`--verify` requires a computed `PASS`; `--require-pass` is accepted for release
wiring and is implied. `--verify-checkout` additionally asserts that the working
tree HEAD is the supplied target commit. With no target supplied, the checked-out
HEAD is the target.
